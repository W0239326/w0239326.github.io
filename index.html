            <h2>Hello World!</h2>
            <p>Lame programming joke there. Hi! My name is Beth and I am a first year Web Programming student at NSCC.
                As I'm a student My body of work isn't robust yet but I'm working on it.</p>

            <p>I have lived in Nova Scotia my whole life, I'm from Antigonish but have lived in Halifax for 8 years.
            I've always had a healthy interest in changing technologies. It took a little bit of soul searching before
            I realized that programming was where I wanted to make my career. I love it so far and excited to keep
                learning new skills my whole career. Check out the My work page for some samples of my work,
                and if you are so inclined, there is a printable copy of my Resume on the resume page.</p>

            <p>And while I'm on the topic of lame programming jokes, <a href="foo.html" target="_blank"> Foo!</a></p>
